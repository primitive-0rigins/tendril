# Tendril + Pulse

**A self-healing, self-discovering mesh network — built from scratch in Rust.**

> The mesh stays alive on its own. It grows on its own.

---

## Status

Tendril is an early Rust workspace for local mesh discovery, heartbeats, recovery flow,
and a separate Pulse beacon. The current codebase focuses on the local-network path first;
relay, WireGuard, NAT traversal, and dashboard work are tracked in the roadmap.

---

## The Problem

Most mesh systems are push — you configure a node, tell it where the mesh is, and manually onboard it. If a node goes silent, someone has to notice and act.

Tendril inverts both of those.

---

## Two Programs. One Idea.

### Tendril
The mesh daemon. Runs on every node in your network. It:
- Maintains a live registry of all connected nodes
- Sends and receives heartbeats
- Detects when a node goes silent
- Attempts recovery automatically (Wake-on-LAN, reconnect)
- Listens for Pulse beacons and pulls new nodes into the mesh

### Pulse
The beacon. A small, standalone program you drop on any machine. It:
- Knows nothing about the mesh
- Broadcasts a UDP announcement on the local network every 15 seconds: *"I exist"*
- Waits

When Tendril hears a Pulse, it reaches out, assigns the node an ID, and sends it the peer list. The node is in. No manual configuration.

### Message Protocol

All messages are JSON over UDP.

| Message | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pulse_announce` | Pulse → Network | "I exist, come find me" |
| `mesh_invite` | Tendril → Pulse | "You're in. Here are your peers." |
| `heartbeat` | Node → Tendril | "Still alive." |
| `recovery_attempt` | Internal | Node went silent, attempting WoL |

### Recovery Flow

```
Node goes silent
      │
      ▼
heartbeat_watcher detects timeout
      │
      ▼
MAC address known? ──Yes──► Send WoL magic packet
      │                            │
      No                     Wait for heartbeat
      │                            │
      ▼                            ▼
Mark: Recovering          Alive again? ──Yes──► Mark: Alive
                                   │
                                   No
                                   ▼
                              Mark: Dead

## Getting Started

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primitive-0rigins/tendril.git
cd tendril
cargo build --release
```

For development:

```bash
cargo test
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

### Run Tendril (mesh daemon)

```bash
# Optional: copy and edit the config
cp tendril.example.toml tendril.toml

RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/tendril
```

### Run Pulse (beacon — on a new machine)

```bash
PULSE_NODE_NAME=my-machine \
PULSE_ADDR=192.168.1.50 \
PULSE_MAC=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff \
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/pulse
```

The mesh will find it within 15 seconds.

---

## Configuration

`tendril.toml` (auto-created with defaults if missing):

```toml
mesh_name = "tendril"
node_name = "node-1"
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:7777"
beacon_multicast = "224.0.0.251:7778"
heartbeat_timeout_secs = 30
heartbeat_interval_secs = 10
```

## Architecture Decisions

| Concern | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| Encryption | `boringtun` — pure Rust WireGuard, no kernel module, runs anywhere |
| NAT traversal | UDP hole-punch attempted first, `tendril-relay` as fallback |
| Relay | Any node with a public IP can act as relay — no single point of failure |
| Key storage | Encrypted file (`~/.tendril/keys`) — portable, protected at rest |
| Pulse identity | Stateful — remembers keypair and assigned node ID across restarts |
| Relay transport | WebSocket over TCP — punches through firewalls, works on port 443 |

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] WireGuard keypair generation via `boringtun` (per-node, encrypted at rest)
- [ ] `tendril-relay` binary — WebSocket broker, introduction only, blind to traffic
- [ ] UDP hole-punch NAT traversal with relay fallback
- [ ] Any tendril node with public IP can elect itself as relay
- [ ] Persistent node registry (survive daemon restarts)
- [ ] Stateful Pulse — remembers keypair and assigned ID
- [ ] Mesh key gate on both local and relay paths
- [ ] CLI — `tendril status`, `tendril nodes`, `tendril eject <node>`
- [ ] TUI dashboard
